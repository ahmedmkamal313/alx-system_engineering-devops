# Command line for the win
This project is a challenge to test and improve your Bash skills using CMD CHALLENGE, a game that presents you with increasingly complicated tasks to perform via the command line.

# Installation
To start this project, I needed to have access to the CMD CHALLENGE website and the sandbox environment provided by ALX.

I visited [CMD CHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/) and created an account or logged in with my existing account.
I opened a terminal or command prompt on my local machine.
I used the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment. I used the hostname, username, and password provided to me for the sandbox environment.
Once connected, I navigated to the directory where I wanted to upload the screenshots of the completed levels.

# Usage
To complete this project, I needed to finish at least 9 levels of CMD CHALLENGE. Each level had a different task that I needed to perform using Bash commands. I used the hints and resources provided by the website to help me solve the tasks.

For each level that I completed, I took a screenshot of the terminal showing that I passed the test.
I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshot from my local machine to the sandbox environment.
I confirmed that the screenshot had been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory.
I pushed the screenshot with the right name (level_number.png or level_number.jpg) to GitHub, in either the PNG or JPEG format.
I created a screenshot showing that I completed at least 9 levels, and pushed it to GitHub with the name 0-first_9_tasks.png or 0-first_9_tasks.jpg.
