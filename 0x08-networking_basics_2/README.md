# 0x08. Networking basics #1 🚀
This project is about learning the basics of networking, such as localhost, IP address types, netcat, ping, and telnet.

## Localhost 🔥
Localhost is a special hostname that refers to the local computer itself. It is usually represented by the IP address 127.0.0.1 for IPv4 or ::1 for IPv6. Localhost can be used to access local services or test network applications without going through the network. No need to go outside! 😎

## IP address types 💡
There are two types of IP addresses: public and private. A public IP address is a unique identifier that is assigned to a device on the Internet. It can be accessed by anyone on the Internet. A private IP address is a unique identifier that is assigned to a device on a private network. It can only be accessed by devices on the same network or through a router. Don’t tell anyone! 🤫

## Netcat 🌐
Netcat is a command-line utility that can be used to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP protocols. Netcat can be used for various purposes, such as port scanning, transferring files, chatting, testing network services, etc. It’s like a Swiss army knife for networks! 🇨🇭

## Ping ⚡
Ping is a command-line utility that sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo request packets to a specified destination and measures the round-trip time and packet loss. Ping can be used to test the connectivity and latency of a network device.

## Telnet 💻
Telnet is a command-line utility that allows remote login and communication with another device using the Telnet protocol. Telnet can be used to access and control network devices or services that support the Telnet protocol.
