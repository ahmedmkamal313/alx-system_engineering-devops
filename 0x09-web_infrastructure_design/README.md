# 0x09. Web infrastructure design

This project is a collection of web infrastructure designs that could be implemented in any web development project. The designs are presented as diagrams that illustrate the components and connections of each web infrastructure.

## Designs Presented

- [Simple web stack](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/0-simple_web_stack): A basic web infrastructure consisting of a single server that hosts the website, a DNS service that resolves the domain name, and a firewall that protects the server from unauthorized access.
- [Distributed web infrastructure](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/1-distributed_web_infrastructure): A more advanced web infrastructure that adds load balancing and redundancy to the simple web stack, improving the performance and availability of the website.
- [Secured and monitored web infrastructure](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure): A further improved web infrastructure that adds SSL encryption, health checks, and monitoring tools to the distributed web stack, enhancing the security and reliability of the website.
- [Scaled up web infrastructure](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x09-web_infrastructure_design/3-scale_up): A scalable web infrastructure that adds database sharding and CDN caching to the secured and monitored web stack, increasing the capacity and efficiency of the website.
