This project is about debugging a web stack that runs Nginx as a web server. The main goal is to learn how to run software as another user in Linux and how to configure Nginx to listen on different ports and IPs.

## Features

This project contains the following Bash scripts that perform various debugging
- [0-iamsomeoneelse](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x12-web_stack_debugging_2/0-iamsomeoneelse): A script that accepts one argument
- [1-run_nginx_as_nginx](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x12-web_stack_debugging_2/1-run_nginx_as_nginx): A script that configures Nginx to run as the nginx user
- [100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less](https://github.com/ahmedmkamal313/alx-system_engineering-devops/blob/master/0x12-web_stack_debugging_2/100-fix_in_7_lines_or_less): A shorter version of the previous script that uses some tricks and shortcuts to reduce the number of lines and characters
